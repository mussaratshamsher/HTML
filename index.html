      <h2>
        The life cycle of a butterfly is a fascinating and transformative process that unfolds in four distinct stages: egg, 
        larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly. It begins when a female butterfly lays tiny eggs, often on
         the leaves of specific host plants. 
         </h2>
         <h3>
         After a few days to a week, the eggs hatch into caterpillars, which emerge hungry
          and ready to feed. During this larval stage, they consume leaves voraciously, growing rapidly and shedding their 
          skin several times. Once they reach a sufficient size, they enter the pupal stage, attaching themselves to a secure 
          surface to form a chrysalis.
        </h3>

          Inside this protective casing, the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, where it 
          reorganizes its body to emerge as a beautiful adult <span style="color:rgb(1, 21, 24)"><b> butterfly</b></span>. This final stage is characterized by vibrant wings 
          that need to dry and strengthen before the  <span style="color:rgb(3, 38, 39)"><b>butterfly</b> </span> can take flight. The entire life cycle can take anywhere from 
          a few weeks to several months, depending on the species and environmental conditions, showcasing the stunning 
          transformation from a humble egg to a graceful <span style="color:rgb(3, 38, 39)"><b> butterfly</b></span>.
